The kevin. Flutter SDK enables to easily integrate AIS and PIS services in your mobile application.
We provide neat, customisable UI screens so integration would be as quick as possible. We also
expose the low-level APIs that power those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.

Get started with our [SDK reference](https://developer.kevin.eu/mobile/) and checkout
our [Demo App](https://github.com/getkevin/kevin-flutter/tree/master/example).
